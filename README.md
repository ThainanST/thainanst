## 💻 About Me

Hey! I'm Thainan — a Full-Stack Developer, professor, investor wannabe, and occasional grappler on the jiu-jitsu mat. I split my time between writing code, mentoring students, and studying finance like my portfolio depends on it (because it does 🤑).

I spend most of my dev hours crafting solid back-end solutions with Node.js, TypeScript, Python — and recently, Java (we're still getting to know each other). I do touch the front-end when needed, especially with Vue.js and Bootstrap, but let's just say I feel more at home behind the scenes making things *work*.

By day, I teach Digital Electronics and Power Electronics at UFOP. By night, I’m either improving my guard passes or cramming for the CEA certification from ANBIMA so I can actually understand what my money is doing.

I'm also the creator of [escrevendomeutcc.com](https://escrevendomeutcc.com), a space where I help students survive the thesis-writing jungle.

Let’s connect, build, learn — and maybe roll. 🤝💻🥋
